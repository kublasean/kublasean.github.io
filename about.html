            I am a software engineer who believes in clean, easy-to-read, and obvious code. I prefer simplicity to complexity 
            whenever possible, even when it means a few more lines of code. Programming doesn't need to be difficult or exclusionary.

            My goal is to always get stuff done in a way that allows anyone to contribute and build off my work. I want to share
            knowledge, not hoard it.

            My favorite programming languages are C++, Swift, Java, JavaScript, and Python. Hmmm... that's a lot of favorites, but
             I believe being a good software engineer means using the right tool for the job. The more tools at my disposal the better!

            Outside of software my passion is playing drums. I've been obsessed with drumset since I was 12-years-old. If you like rock music
            you might enjoy <a target="_blank" href="https://highheatrocks.com/">checking out a band I play in, High Heat!</a>

    In my career so far I have worked mostly on mobile development, embedded systems, and software integrations with drones and robots.
