            I am a software engineer who believes in clean, easy-to-read, and obvious code. I prefer simplicity to complexity 
            whenever possible, even when it means a few more lines of code. Programming doesn't need to be difficult or exclusionary.

            The point should be getting stuff done in a way that allows anyone to contribute and build off your work, not to show off how smart you are.

            My favorite languages are C++, Swift, Java, Swift, JavaScript, and Python. Hmm... that seems like a lot of favorites, 
            now that you mention it. 
            For me though, being a good software engineer means using the Right Tool For The Job - so the 
            more tools the better!
