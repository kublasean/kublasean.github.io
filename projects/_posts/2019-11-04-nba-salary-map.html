Each rectangle represents a player and is scaled by that player's contract size for the
selected year. Players are grouped by their teams, indicated by their color and abbreviation.
Press <b>previous</b> or <b>next</b> to step through available seasons. Hover (or click on mobile) over a player to 
see their name and contract in millions or thousands of dollars.

Note: the scale can change dramatically between years, and this data is from 2019
