<p>Using the same tech stack as this blog I created a custom website for my band, High Heat. <a target="_blank" href="https://highheatrocks.com/">Check it out here!</a>
   Some features are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Slick animated menu dropdown on small screens</li>
    <li>Faster image load times with <code>srcset</code> elements</li>
    <li>Responsive art direction for hero image on home page for horizontal or vertical screens with <code>picture</code> element</li>
    <li>Photo gallery with small, compressed thumbnails to reduce page load</li>
    <li>Responsive font size scaling</li>
    <li>Flame emoji favicon (best feature if you ask me!!)</li>
</ul>
